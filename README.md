# 🔐 Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to review browser extensions installed in a web browser (Google Chrome in this case), identify any suspicious or unnecessary extensions, and remove them. This helps improve browser performance and enhances personal security and privacy.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (Version XX.X or higher)
- Chrome Extension Manager (chrome://extensions)
- Online research for extension legitimacy

---

## 🔎 Steps Performed

### 1. Opened Extension Manager
- Accessed via: `chrome://extensions`
- Reviewed all extensions currently installed.

### 2. Checked Each Extension
For each extension, I reviewed:
- **Name**
- **Permissions requested**
- **User reviews & rating on Chrome Web Store**
- **Developer reputation**
- **Last updated date**

### 3. Removed Suspicious or Unused Extensions
Extensions that were either unused, outdated, had poor reviews, or requested excessive permissions were removed.

Example of a removed extension:
- **Name:** "PDF Converter Free"
- **Reason:** Unfamiliar, requested access to all website data, and had reports of adware behavior.

### 4. Restarted Browser
To apply changes and improve performance.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Many extensions ask for excessive permissions (e.g., "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit").
- Extensions can silently monitor user activity or inject ads.
- It’s important to only install extensions from trusted developers.
- Unused extensions should be regularly reviewed and removed.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Browser Extensions
- Only install extensions from verified developers.
- Regularly review permissions granted.
- Remove extensions you don’t actively use.
- Keep extensions updated.
- Use browser in Incognito to avoid extension tracking (if not enabled there).

## 🔐 Key Concepts
- **Browser Extensions:** Small software programs that modify and enhance browser functionality.
- **Security Risks:** Some extensions can spy on users or insert malware/adware.
- **Permissions:** Red flags include access to all web data, clipboard, or browsing history.

## 📌 Conclusion
This task improved my awareness of how extensions can compromise browser security. I now understand the importance of reviewing and managing browser extensions for a safer browsing experience.
